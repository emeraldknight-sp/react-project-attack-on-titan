## üíª Project

In this project I used React to bring to life a fluid and responsive interface using the resources provided by the @Emotion library (CSS-in-JS), working on the concept of modularization components were created, requests were made and handled with Axios to supply the context of the application within the Context API.

The code was treated with some linters and formatters to guarantee a cohesive and coherent code structure, thus reducing the chances of syntax errors occurring with Typescript and the automation process carried out with the help of Husky and Lint-staged.
